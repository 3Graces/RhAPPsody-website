            The history of the International Museum and Library of Music in Bologna begins with Father Giovanni Battista Martini, a scholar and tireless collector from the 18th century. Martini assembled one of the most prestigious collections of printed music, manuscripts, opera librettos, and portraits of musicians. Concerned about the fate of his collection, in 1750, he secured a guarantee from Pope Benedict XIV that it would be preserved in perpetuity at the convent of San Francesco.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This decision proved to be both a blessing and a risk: with the arrival of Napoleonic troops, the collection faced confiscation. It was saved by Martini's successor, Stanislao Mattei. Through a clever ruse, Mattei moved the most important works to his home, presenting them as his personal library. He also managed to have the rest of the collection transferred to the National Institute of Sciences and Arts, preventing its dispersal.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 1816, this valuable heritage was donated to the Municipality of Bologna, and in 1827, it was consolidated in the library of the Liceo Musicale, established in 1804. The library continued to grow through donations and targeted acquisitions, particularly under the direction of Gaetano Gaspari, who created an exemplary catalog of the collection.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 1942, the Liceo Musicale became a Conservatory, but the Municipality retained ownership of the collection, which in 1959 formed the Civic Museum of Musical Bibliography. This museum later merged into the International Museum and Library of Music, which opened in 2004 at Palazzo Sanguinetti.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The idea behind the museum was to make the vast musical heritage owned by the Municipality of Bologna accessible to the public, much of which had previously been confined to storage.

            We chose the International Museum of Music in Bologna because we wanted to draw attention to a type of museum that often takes a back seat. While music experts are typically the most excited about visiting a music museum, our goal was to make the visit more authentic and engaging for non-experts as well, sparking a deep curiosity about the subject.</p>

<p>After all, music has always accompanied humankind throughout history. It is a <strong>universal language</strong>, a means of communication capable of conveying emotions, identities, and cultures without the need for words. This is exactly why music is so close to us, an element of our daily lives we often don't even notice.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Museum of Music preserves and enhances this heritage through rare instruments, ancient treatises, scores, and testimonies that reveal how music has influenced life and culture over the centuries, thus demonstrating its great potential and its ability to offer new and <strong>fascinating perspectives</strong>.

    <h5>Conclusions</h5>
    <p>Our research revealed a key finding: curiosity and openness to a music museum aren't strictly dependent on a person's academic background or professional field.

We observed that while there's a slight tendency for those with a humanities background to visit these places, the difference compared to those with another background is minimal. This shows that an interest in the world of music is a <strong>cross-cutting</strong> experience that transcends professional and academic boundaries.</p>

<p>Therefore, our challenge is to capture this <strong>curiosity</strong> and transform it into genuine <strong>enthusiasm</strong> for visiting this type of museum, making the world of music accessible to everyone, regardless of their life path. To make its mark, a music museum needs to offer something <strong>innovative</strong> and different, capable of competing with more frequently visited types of museums.

This is demonstrated by the fact that in a large city, only about 25% of people say they would definitely visit a music museum, while around 70% consider it a secondary choice. This dynamic changes in small towns and villages, where people show a greater inclination to visit, often because it's seen as a unique local attraction or, at times, the only one available.</p>

      <div> <div class="domain-subsection">
      <div class="idea-content">
        <div class="idea-text">
      <p>Our design approach is defined as <strong>concept oriented design</strong>, aimed at obtaining <strong>an emotional and/or cognitive result on the users</strong>. This goal is guided by two fundamental concepts: authenticity and curiosity.</p>

<p>First and foremost, for us, <strong>authentic</strong> is what touches the deeper self of a person (K. Jaspers), creating a memorable, meaningful, and emotionally engaging experience. An authentic experience is designed to stimulate <strong>emotional responses</strong>. This authenticity is achieved, for example, through <strong>embodiment</strong>: by including a immersive visual and audio experience in the user journey, we make users the protagonists of their visit. This is also achieved through <strong>gesture-based interactions</strong> with touchscreens using the interactive app, or with the movement of placing headphones over ears. These emotional responses are the catalyst that allows us to develop a <strong>sense of familiarity</strong>, creating a personal and lasting connection between the visitor and the content, even when it is new or unknown.</p>

<p>The second pillar is curiosity. <strong>Curiosity</strong> was defined as the desire for knowledge that sparks exploratory behavior (Berlyne, 1978). We sought to stimulate it by exposing visitors to images of unusual and unknown instruments, to prompt their desire to investigate and discover. This is because curiosity arises from the awareness of a <strong>knowledge gap</strong>; it is the recognition of something <strong>unknown</strong> that triggers the desire to fill that gap. In essence, it is true that in daily life the unknown triggers curiosity, and our project strategically uses this principle to motivate exploration and active learning.</p>

            <ul class="music-list">

            <p><strong>Which are main needs and characteristics?</strong></p>
            <p>At the base there must be a component of curiosity towards music, together with various needs:</p>
            <ul class="music-list">
              <li>Learn more about the history of music and musical instruments in an interactive way</li>
              <li>Live memorable experiences</li>
              <li>Defeat museum fatigue with stimuli of different nature</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>Through our <strong>questionnaire</strong>, especially through the section relating to socio-demographic and personal data, we identified two types of <strong>personas</strong>.</p>
            <p>A persona is a concrete representation of the different types of people a system or service is being designed for. Personas don't describe real people; instead, they're based on <strong>real data</strong> collected from many individuals. They are model or composite characters that provide meaningful <strong>archetypes</strong> you can use to assess your design.</p>
            <p>The stereotypes we have defined present different characteristics: they are of different ages, represent both genders, and one has a humanities background while the other does not. Neither is an expert in music, but both are curious about the subject.
One is particularly attracted to interactive learning methods, while the other sees interactivity as a way to stimulate himself and keep his mind active.</p>

  <p>So, we focused on people who are curious about or open to the world of music, but aren't experts. These individuals appreciate museums with an interactive component, whether for a personal or an educational reason. The interactive elements help make their visit more authentic and memorable, which in turn fuels their enthusiasm for the world of music.</p>
          
          <!-- Activities Subsection -->
          <div class="pact-subsection">
            <h4 class="dropcap-first"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ctivities</h4>
            <p>The activities visitors engage in shape their museum experience. About the activities we have designed for the museum experience:</p>
            <p><strong>What is the main problem to solve?</strong></p>
            <p>The main problem we faced was how to introduce a non-expert audience to music and its instruments, making the museum experience not only educational but also engaging and accessible. 
              Many visitors, in fact, aren't musicians or expert musicians, and a traditional museum might seem intimidating.
            Our goal was to demonstrate that music is something simple, accessible, and interactive.</p>
            <p><strong>What are main needs and requirements?</strong></p>
<p>We included a personality quiz in the <strong>RhAPPsody app</strong> that not only makes the visitors the protagonists of their experience but also allows them to learn something new.

To spark curiosity and make the journey more stimulating, we also created a quiz that challenges the user to distinguish between real musical instruments and those generated by artificial intelligence. Some of the instruments we show are very unique and unusual, and many visitors aren't familiar with them. This element of surprise and discovery creates a fun and memorable experience. Furthermore, the approach is educational: the quiz encourages the user to try to improve, remember the correct answers, and deepen their knowledge of the instruments to get better and better. In this way, the visitor isn't just playing; they're learning actively and with curiosity.</p>
             <p><strong>How long the activity will last? Regularly? In calm or busy moment?</strong>
              <p>The activities we designed are meant to be done during quieter times, away from the busiest visitor flows. The goal is to give the public the <strong>freedom</strong> to dedicate as much time as they want to each individual experience, without feeling rushed or pressured.

Flexibility is a crucial aspect. In fact, some of the activities require scanning a QR code, which means visitors can choose to explore content at any time, even after they've returned home. This freedom allows them to experience the museum at their own pace, transforming the visit into a completely <strong>personalized journey</strong> that doesn't end within the exhibition walls.</p>
            <p><strong>Is activity meant to be done together or alone? Does it require cooperation?</strong></p>
            <p>Mainly the activities are carried out autonomously, not necessarily in cooperation with others.</p>
             <p><strong>Is the activity simple and well defined with little choices? Or complex and need guidance step by step?</strong></p>
             <p>Since our goal is to make the museum as accessible as possible for everyone, the activities we have designed are very simple, suitable, and easy to understand for all ages.</p>
              <p><strong>Has the activity potential impact on users‚Äô security?</strong></p>
              <p>The activities have no impact on safety.</p>
              <p><strong>Input data needed? Output? Media? Requirements related to those data?</strong></p>

              <p>The museum offers a serene and relaxed atmosphere, a peaceful oasis in the heart of the city. Its elegantly climate-controlled rooms are located within a prestigious, historic building, ensuring an immersive experience in a well-kept and tranquil environment. The lighting, which is exclusively artificial, creates an intimate and focused ambiance, highlighting the instruments on display and inviting visitors to a quiet, contemplative tour, far from the noise and chaos of the outside world.</p>
          <p><strong>Alone or together? Friends or unknown? Language? Religious? Disability? Feedback sound is acceptable?</strong>
            <p>Anyone can visit the museum: independently, with family or friends, large groups of people and school groups.</p>
            <p><strong>The working environment? Staff? Who do people work? Role? Management structure?</strong>
              <p>During regular museum visiting hours, a staff member is available in each room to provide general information and ensure the safety of the works.</p>

            <strong>Bard</strong>, a minstrel, serves as the visitor's personal guide, accompanying them on an interactive journey into the world of music. 
            For visitors who are deaf or hard of hearing, the audio guide is also available in written form, so they can read everything Bard says.

            The experience is enhanced by calm and relaxing music, composed by us, interwoven with natural sounds that evoke the paintings of green bushes 
            and flowers decorating the museum walls.
          </p>

          <p><strong>The app activities include:</strong></p>
          <ul class="music-list">
            <li><strong>Detective quiz:</strong> visitors analyze and investigate images to distinguish between real content and AI-generated content. 
                At the end, a leaderboard displays the participants' scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Personality test:</strong> based on their answers, each visitor is matched with a musical instrument that reflects their personality.</li>
            <li><strong>Musical game:</strong> visitors can virtually play different instruments to discover their sounds.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In each room, beneath every displayed instrument, there is also a tablet with the dedicated <strong>RhAPPsody</strong> version. 
            This simplified version allows visitors to pluck the strings of the instruments and hear their sounds. 
            While more basic than the smartphone app, it focuses on stimulating auditory perception and increasing engagement 
            through direct touchscreen interaction and agency given to visitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea is that visitors first try out the tablets in the exhibition rooms and, once intrigued, scan the QR codes 
            to unlock the full app on their smartphones, gaining access to additional activities and content.
          </p>

          <p>
            That said, we leave visitors complete freedom to choose how they wish to experience the exhibition.

            For the development of the interactive prototype, we used different tools according to our needs. 
For the mobile version (scannable via QR code), we used Figma, a powerful and versatile web-based design tool, ideal for creating fluid and visually engaging user interfaces. However, Figma does not support the integration of complex audio elements.

For this reason, for the on-site tablet version physically present in the museum, we chose ProtoPie, another prototyping tool. This allowed us to implement the sonic interactions that are fundamental for an authentic musical experience.

            By incorporating AI-generated content alongside real artifacts, we challenge visitors' perceptions of authenticity 
            and encourage critical thinking about what constitutes "real" musical heritage in the digital age.

            The prototyping and design process behind RhAPPsody involved user research, iterative testing, 
            and a human-centered approach to ensure the application meets the diverse needs of museum visitors. 
            We focused on creating an intuitive interface that enhances the physical exhibition.
